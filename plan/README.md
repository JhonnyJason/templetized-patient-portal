# Devloop Planning Document

Here we maintain all the documentation for "project-management".
This should be a starting point for knowing:
- what is the plan
- what had been implemented
- what had been deffered to be considered in the future
- what is missing
- what is the next step


From perspective of project management we loop through cycles with 3 phases:
1. (Planning) Define a feature-set to be implemented + what bugs are to be fixed
2. (Implementing) Build and ship the next version
3. (Reflecting) Collect feedback on issues and potential improvements

We always start with a Skeleton v0.0.1
Then ship the first version as v0.1.0
Then any next version will be v0.x.0

The ultimate goal is to arrive at v1.0.0 which does not require any further updates.
